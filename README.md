# HealthBridge NGO – Mini Web App

## About this project
This is a   project built for an internship assignment.  
It is a simple healthcare support page for an NGO, made with only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## What the app has
- One page with:
  - AI Health Assistant (simple rule-based chatbot)
  - Volunteer Registration form
  - Patient Support form

## AI / Automation idea
I added a basic **FAQ chatbot**.  
When the user types words like **medicine**, **volunteer**, **eligibility**, **services**, or **contact**,  
the chatbot shows a prepared answer.  
This can reduce repeated questions for NGO staff and volunteers.

## NGO use-case
- Patients can ask common questions and submit a help request.
- Volunteers can register their details and skills.
- The NGO can later use this data to connect patients and volunteers.

## Tech stack
- HTML – structure
- CSS – basic styling
- JavaScript – chatbot logic and form alerts
- Hosting – Vercel / Netlify 

## Notes
This is only a **concept-level prototype** from a student.  
In the future, it can be extended with a backend, database, and real AI API.
